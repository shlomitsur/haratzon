        "דע, שהמחשבה יש לה תוקף גדול, ואם יחזק ויגבר מחשבתו על איזה דבר שבעולם יוכל לפעול שיהיה כך, ואפילו אם יחזק מחשבתו מאד שיהיה לו ממון - בודאי יהיה לו, וכן בכל דבר, רק שהמחשבה תהיה בביטול כל ההרגשות. והמחשבה תקיפה כ"כ עד שאפשר למסור נפשו במחשבתו ממש, דהיינו שירגיש צער המיתה ממש, ע"י שמקבל על עצמו בדעתו שהוא מרצה למסור נפשו על קידוש השם... וכשמחזק המחשבה במסירות נפש כ"כ יכול למות ממש מזה הצער כאילו היה מת מזו המיתה בפועל... על כן צריך למנוע ולהרחיק עצמו לבלי להשאר שם בעת שמרגיש שקרוב שתצא נפשו, שלא ימות בלא עיתו ח"ו"

# “Things are never as they seem. Always dig deeper to find the gold beneath the rock”


# “Embarrassment is a pointless emotion that only serves to confuse and over exaggerate reality”

“Irrational self confidence is worth more than rational defeatism”

To live in no one’s reality but the one you’ve created for yourself is to achieve true happiness

Giving is one of the most underrated tactics to getting what you want

Quiet patience and adaptive persistence are the two keys to perpetual happiness

Don’t indulge in distractions that are short-lived and derail your long term efforts


# “Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything to do and you've done it.” -- **[Margaret Thatcher](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/198468.Margaret_Thatcher)**

Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.

 Managing one’s wants is the most powerful skill a person can learn.

Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.

Everyone you meet is better than you at something.

Getting truly organized can vastly improve anyone’s life.

 It’s easy to make someone’s day just by being uncommonly pleasant to them.

 Problems, when they arise, are rarely as painful as the experience of fearing them.

 A good nine out of ten bad things I’ve worried about never happened. A good nine out of ten bad things that did happen never occurred to me to worry about

"Normalcy is overrated. If you tap into your natural creativity, you have a chance to be extraordinary."  David Kelly

Fear and stress depresses curiosity => less creativity

we human beings, we human individuals, we live far within our limits.  William James

Paul Torrance on creativity ” I know it can be done” He has done it himself. His wife has done it. And he's seen excellent teachers do it.

“Nothing important comes with instructions” james richardson

“in your day practicing self control (doing the right thing)is more important than consuming new information” shlomi

“All models are wrong, but some are useful.”  George E. P. Box 

A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep - Saul Bellow

“An educated man should know everything about something, and something about everything.” **[C.V. Wedgwood](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5960462.C_V_Wedgwood)**

“Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.” John Kenneth Galbraith

Colin Powell once shared knowledge we can all benefit from, a formula to determine when to take action. Simply put, he uses a metric called P = 40 to 70, where P stands for the probability of success and the numbers indicate the percentage of information acquired so far. Once 40% to 70% of the knowledge is collected and probability of success is at least 40%, you are at the decision point of action. Go with your gut and then take immediate action. This means that you should always have enough information to support your theories, but if you sit around waiting for all the information and the probability of success to be 100%, it will be too late.


# “Business is all about departing from your current plateau, point (A), with the intent of getting to your next achievement, point (B). Maybe you want to start selling your first service offering. Currently your sales are at $0; that is (A). You want to have your sales at $400,000 by the end of the year, that’s (B). If you have limiting beliefs they will establish a wall. The wall will block your progress and may even cause you to take other directions that might make things worse.”

Believe that inexperience is an asset, allowing you to think outside of the box in ways your competition can’t even imagine


# “Money is never a prize; it’s a commodity, a means for getting things done. Money simply transfers economic value from place to place so that people are able to work together." Oren Klaff


# “I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.” Charlie Munger 


# “Success In Life Is Directly Proportional To The Number Of Awkward Conversations You’re Willing To Have.”

Poor Charlie’s almanack 

**_What should a young person look for in a career?_**

_“I have three basic rules. Meeting all three is nearly impossible, but you should try anyway:_

_Don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy yourself_

_Don’t work for anyone you don’t respect and admire_

_Work only with people you enjoy_

_I have been incredibly fortunate in my life. Warren and I had all three._

**_What overall life advice do you have for young people?_**

_Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. You build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day-by-day, and at the end of the day - if you live long enough - like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve._

_Life and its various passages can be hard, brutally hard. The three things I have found helpful in coping with its challenges are:_

_Have low expectations_

_Have a sense of humor_

_Surround yourself with the love of friends and family_

_Above all, live with change and adapt to it. If the world didn’t change, I’d still have a twelve hándicap._

“

“I've probably had more opportunities to study successful people at close range than any other man living today. I have observed that they constantly think in terms of things they can do, never in terms of things they can't do. I once asked Henry Ford if there's anything he wanted to do that he couldn't do. He said, "Why, no. I don't think about the things I can't do. I think about the things I can do." The majority of people are not like that. They think and worry about the things they can't do. Consequently, they can't do them. In other words, they think about the money they don't have, and worry about it. Consequently, they don't have it, and never get it. Money is a peculiar thing, isn't it? It doesn't follow the fellow who doesn't believe he's got a right to get it. I wonder why that is? Money is an inanimate thing; I don't believe it's the fault of the money. No, the fault's not there, it's in the mind of the person who doubts that he can get it. “ Napoleon Hill

“This mind power stuff is very powerful, potent, marvelous, and profound once you become acquainted with it and start using it. This is the medium by which one's thought habits may be controlled until they are taken over by cosmic habit force.” Napoleon Hill

“Complete abstinence is easier than perfect moderation”

“"Each time you are honest and conduct yourself with honesty, a success force will drive you toward greater success. Each time you lie, even with a little white lie, there are strong forces pushing you toward failure." — Joseph Sugarman

“A lack of fear of embarrassment is what allows one to be proactive. It’s what makes a person take on challenges that others write off as too risky. It’s what makes you take the first step before you know what the second step is” Scott Adams

“Every Skill You Acquire Doubles Your Odds of Success” -- Scott Adams

“When it comes to skills, quantity often beats quality” -- Scott Adams

“Everything you learn becomes a shortcut for understanding something else.” Scott Adams

### _“looking back, I don’t regret that I didn’t make more money or become better known, or any of those things. I do regret that I didn’t wise up as fast as I could have but there’s a blessing in that, too. Now that I’m 92, I still have a lot of ignorance left to work on.” charlie munger_

### There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)


### “The lesson is simple: If you’ve got as much as you’ve got, use it. Use it to become the best in the world, to change the game, to set the agenda for everyone else. You can only do that by marshaling all of your resources to get through the biggest possible Dip. In order to get through that Dip, you’ll need to quit everything else. If it’s not going to put a dent in the world, quit. Right now. Quit and use that void to find the energy to assault the Dip that matters. Go ahead, make something happen. We’re waiting!” seth godin

# “The Relentless Pursuit of Awesome“ (leerom segal)

“I gain knowledge from reading a few 10-K's while others are tweeting what they had for breakfast” (buffett)_

“The rich invest in time, the poor invest in money.” — Warren Buffett.

Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior. (buffett)

“It’s not greed that drives the world, but envy.” (buffett)

“We don't have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest.” (buffett)

“Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.” (buffett)

It is awfully hard work doing nothing (oscar wild)

“It’s important to think about the opportunity cost of this hour. On one hand you can check twitter, read some online news, and reply to a few emails while pretending to finish the memo that is supposed to be the focus of your attention. On the other hand, you can dedicate the time to improving yourself. In the short term, you’re better off with the dopamine laced rush of email and twitter while multitasking. In the long term, the investment in learning something new and improving yourself goes further.”

 

“The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power,” Buffett told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in an interview released by the panel last week. “If you’ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor, you’ve got a very good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10 percent, then you’ve got a terrible business.” 

what you are doing today is important because you are exchanging a day in your life for it.

He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.

I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-predict-34">[34]</a></sup>

“I recognize that I may be wrong. This makes me insecure. My sense of insecurity keeps me alert, always ready to correct my errors. I do this on two levels. On the abstract level, I have turned the belief in my own fallibility into the cornerstone of an elaborate philosophy. 

On a personal level, I am a very critical person who looks for defects in myself as well as in others. But, being so critical, I am also quite forgiving. I couldn't recognize my mistakes if I couldn't forgive myself. To others, being wrong is a source of shame; to me, recognizing my mistakes is a source of pride. Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes.”

**You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls -- family, health, friends and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered.**

Ted Weschler on moving away from the noise:

“The move out of the city was for a reason, he said. “That was one of the real takeaways for me in all of the reading that I did over the years about Warren, was how important it was to stay away from the noise.”

In 2000, Weschler formed his own investment fund, Peninsula Capital Advisors LLC., managed from Charlottesville with a researcher and an assistant. “It was really more of a library. We really kept outside noise out of the place. I certainly shaped Peninsula based on what Warren had done with Berkshire.””
